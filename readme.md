# Bright Analytics Test

Hello =>

It was a pleasure to meet everyone in the team yesterday.



Please find the results of my test at the appropriately named files. 

They do run with output logs via a `node ./Question[i].js`

---

It was an enjoyable test. There are plenty of questions that arise when looking at the JSON in regards to making my code less imperitive. But as with a sandboxed test, I made my assumptions best where I saw fit.

**Question 1**

I gave an example of JSX usage, but in production I would want to wrap the views in clearer functions, making the JSX clearer and more succinct.

**Question 2**

I think I forced it to do what I wanted, but I am not liking my use of `forEach` as I would want to `break` out of the recurrsive functions if a match was made, rather than having to seek through all possibilities.
